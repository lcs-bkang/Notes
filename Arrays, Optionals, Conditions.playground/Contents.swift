// Arrays let you store multiple values as one value.  For example:
let john = "John Lennon"
let paul = "Paul McCartney"
let george = "George Harrison"
let ringo = "Ringo Starr"
// This line creates the array.
let beatles = [john, paul, george, ringo]

// Trying to call a specific value in an array can be done using offset values.  For example, trying to find Paul can be done like.  Positions are calculated from left to right, starting from 0.
// Tryinig to call a value that doesn't exist will crash Swift
beatles[1]

// Type annotations can be written in an array using these brackets: [String], [Int], [Double], and [Bool].  For example:
let Names: [String] = [john, paul, george, ringo]
// Doubles can't hold numbers such as the one below, while they can hold fractional values.  Integers can hold the number shown below exactly, because they can't hold fractional values.
let double: Double = 90000000000000000000001
let int: Int = 9000000000000000001
// Can't add doubles and integers together because the value difference, and the way the value is held is different.  Can cause issues, so Swift doesn't do it.

// Divison remainder sign %.
// If the value isn't exactly divisible, then the remainder sign takes the leftovers and uses it to calculate how much was left over.

// An operator along with an equals sign, that does an operation, and reassigns the result back to the variable.

// Comparison operators

firstScore > secondScore

// This also works with strings, as they have a natural alphabetical order.

// Conditions

let firstCard = 11

// You can use else and else if to chain results.

// Combining conditions.

// The codes are && pronouced and, and || pronounced or.

let age1 = 12

if age1 > 18 && age2 > 18 {

if age1 > 18 || age2 > 18 {
    print("At least one is over 18")

// Both && and || can be used more than once in a condition.

// Inserting parentheses within the multiple conditions tells Swift how to interpret it.

// Ternary operator
// It checks for a condition in the first value, and if true, it returns the second value, but if false, uses the third value.
